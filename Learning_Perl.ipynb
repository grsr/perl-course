      "Perl is widely used by biologists to solve problems we encounter when handling DNA and protein sequences, file format conversions, as well as many any other tasks that are computationally repetitive. Perl is not the only language for these tasks but one of many. \n",

      "Perl comes preinstalled on Macs and Linux distributions. It can be downloaded for PCs (see [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/get.html#win32) for details; [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com) is a good choice). \n",

      "Perl is designed to work like a natural language. Just as there are many different ways to say roughly the same thing in a natural language, so there are many different ways to solve a problem using Perl. Perl's motto is [\"There's More Than One Way To Do It\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There's_more_than_one_way_to_do_it). This has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, Perl can be easily adopted by many different communities and applied to many different problems; it is heavily used by organisations like the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/perl.shtml) and [Amazon](http://highscalability.com/amazon-architecture) and was instrumental in the completion of the [Human Genome Project](http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/How_Perl_saved_human_genome). On the other hand, it can be horribly abused, just like [natural languages](http://icanhas.cheezburger.com/lolcats).\n",

      "Perl programs (also known as scripts) are series of instructions that we save in plain text files. As computers do not understand Perl directly, our scripts must be processed by a program called the Perl interpreter, which translates the scripts into machine language. This program is run from the command line. To get started with Perl, we must get acquainted with the command line.\n",

If you see your directory in the list - let's say it's called `mydir` - you can move into that directory by entering the command `cd mydir`.

      "\n",
      "1. If there is an error in your code that the interpreter can't make sense of, it will fail to run. But it can also warn you about problems in the code that it can interpret, but which are probably not going to work correctly. You can turn on these warnings by putting this at the top of your script:\n",
      "    - `use warnings;`\n",

      "    - `# Print the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology`\n",

      "\n",
      "3. It's useful to run scripts directly at the command line, without using the Perl interpreter, like this:\n",
      "    - `central_dogma.pl`\n",
      "\n",
      "    You don't have to do this for this course, but if you want to in future, and you are using Linux or a Mac, you can add this line to the top of your scripts:\n",
      "    - `#!/usr/bin/env perl`\n",
      "\n",
      "    If you do this, you will also need to make your script *executable*, that is, runnable by the Terminal. You can do this by changing the file's permissions using the `chmod` command. This is how we add execute access (`x`) to our script:\n",
      "    - `chmod +x central_dogma.pl`\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Many Perl guides will tell you to add `use strict;` to every script you write (like `use warnings;` above). This tells the Perl interpreter to complain if you use some of the more dangerous Perl idioms in your code. It's not too important for the course, as we won't be using any of those idioms, but it's not a bad idea to use it in scripts you write and actually use."

But the brackets on the `int` line arguably clutter up the line rather than making it clearer. Sometimes the brackets will be necessary, however, to tell Perl which arguments belong to which function. As `int` only takes one argument, there is no ambiguity here, but we will shortly see some examples where the brackets are required. This is something you will figure out through experience."
